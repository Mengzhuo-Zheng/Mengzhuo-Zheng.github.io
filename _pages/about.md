My name is Mengzhuo Zheng (郑孟卓), a BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH ASSISTANT from [Institute of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University](https://www.pku-iaas.edu.cn/). My reseach interests are worldwide and mainly focus on T2T genome assembly, pan-genome construction, multi-omics analysis and etc. In the future, I hope to combine the latest data science technologies(such as Deep Learning Framework) and bioinfomatics to solve the certain biological problems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junhui Zhou](https://www.pku-iaas.edu.cn/list_38/71.html) of Strawberry Developmental Biology and Germplasm Resources Innovation Laboratory, IAAS-PKU and [A.P. Shoucheng Liu](https://www.pku-iaas.edu.cn/list_28/371.html) of Bioinformatics Platform, IAAS-PKU. I was advised by [Prof. Jinshui Zheng](https://faculty.hzau.edu.cn/zhengjinshui/zh_CN/index) and [A.P. Qingye Zhang](https://coi.hzau.edu.cn/info/1093/3028.htm) of College of Informatics, HZAU.
